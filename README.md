This repository implements elements from dynamic field theory (DFT) in the [Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai/) framework. More specifically, the repository reimplements the spatial reasoning architecture specified in [A Neural Dynamic Architecture That Autonomously Builds Mental Models](https://www.ini.rub.de/upload/file/1535484449_7a08dac58161aae9652b/kounatidou_05_14.pdf). 

The original architecture is implemented in the GUI of [cedar](https://cedar.ini.rub.de/) and the results from cedar were used as a baseline comparison.
